Integration with Google API and Tripadvisor (Reading external .json) on the map and when clicked on the point should open a window in the form of spam with the numbers of stars of the "restaurant" and an option to reserve a table. When booked, a request will be sent to the Restaurant. 

The Restaurant will have the option of accepting / waiting / rejecting the client's request. When placed on hold will be informed the booking schedule made for the client (rest -> custumer). A history must be saved in the customer profile.

A login and registration page is required (User and Restaurant).
Need development in php (header and footer), xml, javascript, html, css, sql

will need a platform for user/client and one for Restaurant/service

Facebook integration to allow the user can use the accoount, saving in the database all details.
